# Band Page Feature Implementation

## Overview

Implemented a comprehensive band page feature that displays detailed information about bands in a modal dialog. Band pages can be accessed either by clicking on band names in festival cards or by navigating directly to `/bands/{band-key}` URLs.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Band Modal Component (`css/band-modal.css`)

- Responsive modal overlay with smooth animations
- Professional dark theme matching the site design
- Displays:
  - Band logo (centered at top)
  - Band name with country
  - Headline image
  - Description
  - Genres (styled tags)
  - Band members (grid layout)
  - Action buttons for Official Website and Spotify

### 2. Band Manager (`js/band-manager.js`)

- Loads band data from `db.json`
- Validates if bands have complete information
- Creates and manages modal display
- Handles URL routing for band pages
- Supports both modal and standalone page modes
- Browser back/forward button support
- ESC key to close modal

### 3. Clickable Band Tags

- Band names in festival cards are now clickable if they have complete information in the database
- Hover effect with info icon (ℹ)
- Visual feedback on hover
- Only bands with complete data (logo, description, genres, members, etc.) are clickable

### 4. URL Routing Integration

- Direct navigation to `/bands/{band-key}` opens standalone band page
- Modal opening updates URL without page reload
- Closing modal restores previous URL
- Full browser history support

### 5. Standalone Band Pages

- When accessing `/bands/{band-key}` directly:
  - Full page with header and footer
  - Centered modal-style content
  - Same styling as modal version
  - 404 handling for non-existent bands

## Files Modified/Created

### New Files

- `/css/band-modal.css` - Complete styling for band modal and pages
- `/js/band-manager.js` - Band data management and modal logic

### Modified Files

- `/index.html` - Added band-modal.css and band-manager.js
- `/map.html` - Added band-modal.css and band-manager.js
- `/script.js` - Integrated BandManager, made band tags clickable
- `/js/map.js` - Integrated BandManager in map view
- `/js/router.js` - Added support for `/bands/{key}` routes
