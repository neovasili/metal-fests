## Running the Application

Due to browser CORS restrictions, you cannot open `index.html` directly. You need to serve the files through a local HTTP server.

### Option 1: Using the included Python server (Recommended)

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/neovasili/workspace/personal/metal-fests

# Run the server
python3 server.py
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Option 2: Using Python's built-in server

```bash
# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/neovasili/workspace/personal/metal-fests

# Start the server
python3 -m http.server 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

### Option 3: Using Node.js (if you have it installed)

```bash
# Install a simple server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Navigate to the project directory
cd /Users/neovasili/workspace/personal/metal-fests

# Start the server
http-server -p 8000
```

Then open your browser and go to: **http://localhost:8000**

## Files Structure

```json

  "name": "Festival Name",
  "dates": {
    "start": "2026-MM-DD",
    "end": "2026-MM-DD"
  },
  "location": "City, Country",
  "poster": "image_url_or_path",

## Browser Compatibility

- âœ… Chrome 60+
- âœ… Firefox 55+
- âœ… Safari 12+
- âœ… Edge 79+

## Troubleshooting

**CORS Error**: Make sure you're running a local server instead of opening the HTML file directly.

**Images not loading**: The poster images use Unsplash URLs. If they don't load, check your internet connection or replace with local image paths.

**Port already in use**: If port 8000 is busy, edit `server.py` and change the `PORT` variable to a different number (e.g., 8080, 3000, etc.).
