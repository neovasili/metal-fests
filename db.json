The band's name is a tribute to the 1981 Irish hunger strikers of HM Prison Maze, colloquially called the 'H-Blocks', though Henning Wehland has stated the band is not political. They rose to prominence with their debut album, \"Time to Move,\" released in 1994. The album achieved significant success, spending 62 weeks on the German album chart and selling over 750,000 copies worldwide, earning the band their first gold album. The music videos for \"Risin' High\" and \"Move\" received considerable airplay on MTV, and the band earned a nomination for \"Best Breakthrough Artist\" at the 1995 MTV Europe Music Awards. In 1999, the World Wrestling Federation contacted them to record a song, \"Oh Hell Yeah,\" for wrestler Stone Cold Steve Austin. Between 1994 and 2012, H-Blockx released seven studio albums. In 2024, they celebrated the 30th anniversary of their debut album with a series of concerts and released \"Fallout,\" their first new song in over a decade. In August 2025, they released \"Straight Outta Nowhere,\" their first release under the label Solitary Man Records, founded by the band Donots. They announced the \"Fillin' the Blank\" tour in fall 2025, covering eleven stations in Germany and Switzerland.

In 2012, Deadlands released their debut album, \"Evilution,\" which featured guest appearances from notable guitarists such as Hank Shermann and Michael Denner of Mercyful Fate, and Andy LaRocque of King Diamond. The album received mixed reviews, with some critics praising its aggressive style and others finding it lacking in originality. In 2024, Deadlands signed with Spinefarm Records and released the single \"Villain,\" marking a new chapter in their musical journey. The song delves into themes of empowerment and self-realization, reflecting the band's growth and maturity. In 2025, they announced their upcoming EP, \"Seven,\" set to release on June 27, 2025. Each track on the EP is inspired by one of the seven deadly sins, showcasing the band's ability to intertwine thematic depth with their metalcore sound. The lead single, \"Limbo,\" focuses on the destructive aspects of lust and its impact on personal relationships. Deadlands continues to push the boundaries of their genre, aiming to create music that resonates with a wide audience while staying true to their heavy roots.",

The group consists of frontman and lead guitarist Nick DiSalvo, bassist Jack Donovan, guitarist/keyboardist Michael Risberg, and drummer Georg Edert. Initially, Elder's music was rooted in stoner and doom metal, drawing influences from bands like Kyuss and Sleep. Their 2008 self-titled debut album showcased this heavy, riff-driven style. However, with their 2011 release, \"Dead Roots Stirring,\" the band began incorporating elements of psychedelic and progressive rock, marking a significant evolution in their sound. This trend continued with subsequent albums: \"Lore\" (2015), which delved deeper into progressive rock territories; \"Reflections of a Floating World\" (2017), recognized by Rolling Stone as the fifth-best metal album of that year; and \"Omens\" (2020), which further refined their progressive approach. In 2021, Elder collaborated with the German band Kadavar to release \"Eldovar – A Story of Darkness \u0026 Light,\" blending their styles into a cohesive psychedelic experience. Their latest album, \"Innate Passage,\" released in 2022, continues to explore and expand their progressive rock influences. The band's dynamic compositions often feature extended instrumental passages and intricate melodies, appealing to fans of both metal and psychedelic rock. Elder's music is characterized by its heavy riffs, intricate melodies, and dynamic rhythms, creating immersive and expansive soundscapes.",

The project quickly evolved into a full-fledged band, releasing their debut EP, \"Dark Places,\" in 2021. Their music is characterized by a ferocious blend of black metal's icy malevolence and the raw, uncompromising power of punk, creating a sound that is both aggressive and cathartic. In 2023, they released their first full-length album, \"Void Inside,\" which received critical acclaim for its raw and blackened hardcore style. The album delves into themes of mental health and societal decay, reflecting the band's commitment to addressing pressing social issues through their music. In April 2025, Final Dose released their second full-length album, \"Under the Eternal Shadow,\" via Wolves of Hades. This album continues their exploration of dark themes, incorporating elements of Dungeon Synth and Folk to enhance the bleakness and despair conveyed in their music. The band's lineup has remained consistent, with Bruno F. on vocals, Jack Thompson on bass, and a rotating cast of guitarists and drummers contributing to their evolving sound. Final Dose has also been active on the live circuit, performing across the UK and Europe, and they are scheduled to perform at La Marbrerie in Montreuil, France, on October 31, 2025.

Initially known as Avatar, they changed their name to Savatage before releasing their debut album, \"Sirens,\" in 1983. The band's early sound was rooted in classic heavy metal, drawing influences from bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n\nIn 1987, producer Paul O'Neill joined, introducing symphonic elements that marked a shift towards progressive metal. This collaboration resulted in the critically acclaimed \"Hall of the Mountain King.\" The 1990 album \"Gutter Ballet\" further solidified their progressive metal direction, featuring the title track and \"When the Crowds Are Gone.\"\n\nTragedy struck in 1993 when guitarist Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident. Despite this loss, the band continued, releasing \"Handful of Rain\" in 1994, which included a tribute to Criss titled \"Alone You Breathe.\" Over the years, Savatage has been known for their conceptual albums, such as \"Dead Winter Dead\" (1995), which tells a story set during the Bosnian War.\n\nAfter a hiatus, Savatage reunited in 2014 for a performance at Wacken Open Air. In April 2023, Jon Oliva confirmed plans to record a new studio album, tentatively titled \"Curtain Call,\" with an intended release date of 2026.",

Over the years, the lineup has evolved, currently comprising Andreas Clark (vocals), Ronny Westphal (guitar), Patrik Carlberg Hallgren (bass), and Erik Eklund (drums). The band's music is characterized by a dynamic blend of anthemic modern metal and powerful melodic rock, incorporating elements of alternative rock and electronic rock. Their sound is marked by rapid-fire guitars, growling vocals, and kick drums blasting at double-speed, combined with electronic textures, EDM-style beat drops, and arresting, singable melodies. Lyrically, Self Deception explores themes such as existentialism, nihilism, anti-religious beliefs, and war. They aim to create an atmosphere and deliver a message through their music, focusing on depth and authenticity over mere extremity. In 2023, they released their latest album, \"You Are Only As Sick As Your Secrets,\" which includes hit singles like \"Fight Fire With Gasoline,\" \"PSYCHO,\" and \"Stockholm Hearts.\" The band has shared stages with acts like Electric Callboy, Danko Jones, and Adept, and has performed at prestigious festivals, including the Sweden Rock Festival. In July 2025, Self Deception signed with Napalm Records, marking a significant milestone in their career. They have also announced tours across Europe and North America, bringing their explosive live energy to major events like Open Air Gränichen in Switzerland and Rockstadt Extreme Fest in Romania.",

In 2020, after signing with Napalm Records, Feuerschwanz shifted towards a more serious heavy metal style with the release of \"Das elfte Gebot.\" This marked a significant change in their musical direction, moving away from their comedic roots. The band's lineup includes Hauptmann Feuerschwanz (vocals, guitar, lute), Johanna von der Vögelweide (violin, hurdy-gurdy), and Prinz R. Hodenherz \"Hodi\" III (vocals, guitar, flute, mandolin, Irish bouzouki, bagpipes, various whistles). Other members include Hela (dance, animations), Jan Jamaszyk (bass, vocals), Rollo H. Schönhaar (drums), and Jenny Diehl (dance, animations). Feuerschwanz has released several studio albums, with \"Fegefeuer\" (2023) reaching number one on the official German charts.

Their third album, \"Camgirl,\" released on September 12, 2025, tells the tragic tale of \"Bella Pink,\" an online performer whose story unfolds through the eyes of those who consume her: lovers, relatives, business partners, and stalkers. Musically, the album embraces dance music, party pop, and synthetic ecstasy, while lyrically exploring themes of lust, power, exploitation, and disintegration.

The 1996 album \"Heaven Shall Burn... When We Are Gathered\" marked a shift towards hyper-blast beats and raw vocals, solidifying their reputation for intensity. Throughout their career, Marduk has been known for their aggressive style and controversial themes, often exploring topics like war, death, and Satanism.
