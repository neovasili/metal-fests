The original lineup featured guitarist Kurdt Vanderhoof, vocalist William McKay, lead guitarist Rick \"Chief\" Condrin, bassist Steve Hott, and drummer Rick Wagner. After relocating to Aberdeen, Washington, the band rebranded as Shrapnel before returning to the Metal Church name in 1982. Their self-titled debut album, released in 1984, showcased their thrash metal prowess and set the stage for their rise in the metal scene. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Church_%28album%29))\n\nThroughout the 1980s, Metal Church released several influential albums, including \"The Dark\" (1986) and \"Blessing in Disguise\" (1989), the latter marking the debut of vocalist Mike Howe. The band's lineup experienced changes over the years, with Vanderhoof being the consistent member. After a hiatus in the late 1990s, Metal Church reformed in 2003, releasing \"The Weight of the World\" in 2004. Tragically, vocalist Mike Howe passed away in 2021, but the band continued with new vocalist Marc Lopes, releasing \"Congregation of Annihilation\" in 2023. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metal_Church))\n\nMetal Church is renowned for their tight musicianship and thought-provoking lyrics, often addressing societal issues, inner struggles, and philosophical themes.

The 1996 release, \"None So Vile,\" is often hailed as a seminal work in the genre, noted for its technical proficiency and brutal intensity. Over the years, Cryptopsy has undergone several lineup changes, with drummer Flo Mounier being the consistent member since 1992. The current lineup includes vocalist Matt McGachy, guitarist Christian Donaldson, bassist Olivier Pinard, and drummer Flo Mounier. Their 2023 album, \"As Gomorrah Burns,\" marked their first full-length release in over a decade, followed by \"An Insatiable Violence\" in 2025, both receiving critical acclaim for their technical brutality and modernized sound.

Their visual style and lyrics are inspired by Vikings and Norse mythology, often purposefully over-the-top, which earns them both criticism and praise.

([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Metal))\n\nThe band's lineup includes three vocalists (two male, one female), three guitarists, a bassist, and a drummer.

He had not been playing live shows for some time. Even after his departure, the band still acts as an octet on stage, with Christian Larsson added as live guitarist. He had been playing shows as a replacement for Fehrm since March 2022. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brothers_of_Metal))\n\nThe band's music is characterized by a thunderous, catchy mixture of power metal, irresistible melodies, heavy riffs, and some folkish elements, which they refer to as \"True Heavy Metal.\" ([afm-records.com](https://www.afm-records.com/blogs/news/brothers-of-metal-sign-with-afm-records))\n\nFor more information, you can visit their official website at [brothersofmetal.net](https://www.brothersofmetal.net/).",

The group began as a duo with vocalist George Clarke and guitarist Kerry McCoy, who previously performed together in the grindcore band Rise of Caligula. They recorded and self-released a demo album in April 2010, blending traditional black metal with post-rock elements. The demo led to the recruitment of three additional members and the signing with Deathwish Inc. in December 2010. Their debut album, \"Roads to Judah,\" was released in April 2011, featuring themes of philosophy, melancholy, and introspection. In 2013, Deafheaven released \"Sunbather,\" which received widespread critical acclaim and was named one of the best albums of the year by Spin magazine. The band's third album, \"New Bermuda,\" was released in 2015, followed by \"Ordinary Corrupt Human Love\" in 2018. In 2021, they released \"Infinite Granite,\" marking a departure into a more shoegaze-influenced sound. In 2025, Deafheaven returned to their black metal roots with \"Lonely People with Power,\" released on March 28, 2025, through Roadrunner Records. The album was produced by Justin Meldal-Johnsen and features guest appearances by Interpol's Paul Banks and Boy Harsher's Jae Matthews.

The group consists of frontman and lead guitarist Nick DiSalvo, bassist Jack Donovan, guitarist/keyboardist Michael Risberg, and drummer Georg Edert. Initially, Elder's music was rooted in stoner and doom metal, drawing influences from bands like Kyuss and Sleep. Their 2008 self-titled debut album showcased this heavy, riff-driven style. However, with their 2011 release, \"Dead Roots Stirring,\" the band began incorporating elements of psychedelic and progressive rock, marking a significant evolution in their sound. This trend continued with subsequent albums: \"Lore\" (2015), which delved deeper into progressive rock territories; \"Reflections of a Floating World\" (2017), recognized by Rolling Stone as the fifth-best metal album of that year; and \"Omens\" (2020), which further refined their progressive approach. In 2021, Elder collaborated with the German band Kadavar to release \"Eldovar – A Story of Darkness \u0026 Light,\" blending their styles into a cohesive psychedelic experience. Their latest album, \"Innate Passage,\" released in 2022, continues to explore and expand their progressive rock influences. The band's dynamic compositions often feature extended instrumental passages and intricate melodies, appealing to fans of both metal and psychedelic rock. Elder's music is characterized by its heavy riffs, intricate melodies, and dynamic rhythms, creating immersive and expansive soundscapes.",

The project quickly evolved into a full-fledged band, releasing their debut EP, \"Dark Places,\" in 2021. Their music is characterized by a ferocious blend of black metal's icy malevolence and the raw, uncompromising power of punk, creating a sound that is both aggressive and cathartic. In 2023, they released their first full-length album, \"Void Inside,\" which received critical acclaim for its raw and blackened hardcore style. The album delves into themes of mental health and societal decay, reflecting the band's commitment to addressing pressing social issues through their music. In April 2025, Final Dose released their second full-length album, \"Under the Eternal Shadow,\" via Wolves of Hades. This album continues their exploration of dark themes, incorporating elements of Dungeon Synth and Folk to enhance the bleakness and despair conveyed in their music. The band's lineup has remained consistent, with Bruno F. on vocals, Jack Thompson on bass, and a rotating cast of guitarists and drummers contributing to their evolving sound. Final Dose has also been active on the live circuit, performing across the UK and Europe, and they are scheduled to perform at La Marbrerie in Montreuil, France, on October 31, 2025.

The band's early sound was rooted in classic heavy metal, drawing influences from bands like Judas Priest and Iron Maiden.\n\nIn 1987, producer Paul O'Neill joined, introducing symphonic elements that marked a shift towards progressive metal. This collaboration resulted in the critically acclaimed \"Hall of the Mountain King.\" The 1990 album \"Gutter Ballet\" further solidified their progressive metal direction, featuring the title track and \"When the Crowds Are Gone.\"\n\nTragedy struck in 1993 when guitarist Criss Oliva was killed in a car accident. Despite this loss, the band continued, releasing \"Handful of Rain\" in 1994, which included a tribute to Criss titled \"Alone You Breathe.\" Over the years, Savatage has been known for their conceptual albums, such as \"Dead Winter Dead\" (1995), which tells a story set during the Bosnian War.\n\nAfter a hiatus, Savatage reunited in 2014 for a performance at Wacken Open Air. In April 2023, Jon Oliva confirmed plans to record a new studio album, tentatively titled \"Curtain Call,\" with an intended release date of 2026.",

      "description": "Megadeth is an American thrash metal band formed in Los Angeles in 1983 by vocalist and guitarist Dave Mustaine. After his departure from Metallica, Mustaine established Megadeth, aiming to create a faster and more aggressive sound. The band quickly rose to prominence, becoming one of the \"big four\" of American thrash metal alongside Metallica, Slayer, and Anthrax. Known for their technically complex guitar work and politically charged lyrics, Megadeth has released numerous influential albums, including \"Peace Sells... but Who's Buying?\" (1986), \"Rust in Peace\" (1990), and \"Countdown to Extinction\" (1992). Their 2022 album, \"The Sick, the Dying... and the Dead!\", marked a return to their thrash roots and was praised for its energy and craftsmanship. In August 2025, Megadeth announced their forthcoming album, set to be their final release, accompanied by a farewell tour in 2026. ([apnews.com](https://apnews.com/article/a750ed8043c0fdbc472b472e604f4446)) The current lineup includes Dave Mustaine (vocals, guitar), James LoMenzo (bass), Dirk Verbeuren (drums), and Teemu Mäntysaari (guitar).

Initially conceived as a comedic medieval folk rock ensemble, the band has evolved over the years into a serious heavy metal act. Their early music was characterized by humorous lyrics and brash language, often incorporating innuendo. In 2020, after signing with Napalm Records, Feuerschwanz shifted towards a more serious heavy metal style with the release of \"Das elfte Gebot.\" This marked a significant change in their musical direction, moving away from their comedic roots. The band's lineup includes Hauptmann Feuerschwanz (vocals, guitar, lute), Johanna von der Vögelweide (violin, hurdy-gurdy), and Prinz R. Hodenherz \"Hodi\" III (vocals, guitar, flute, mandolin, Irish bouzouki, bagpipes, various whistles). Other members include Hela (dance, animations), Jan Jamaszyk (bass, vocals), Rollo H. Schönhaar (drums), and Jenny Diehl (dance, animations). Feuerschwanz has released several studio albums, with \"Fegefeuer\" (2023) reaching number one on the official German charts. Their twelfth studio album, \"Knightclub,\" was released on August 22, 2025, continuing their journey in the folk metal genre.",

The name 'Mütterlein' is a reference to Nico's song from the album 'Desertshore,' which deals with the impossible mourning of the maternal bond.

([fr.wikipedia.org](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCtterlein?utm_source=openai)) The EP showcased a minimalist and ritualistic approach, combining post-punk savagery with doom and noise influences.\n\nThe project's second album, 'Bring Down the Flags,' was released in late 2021 by Debemur Morti Productions. This album delved deeper into dark, haunting, and immediate soundscapes, incorporating electronic sounds and blackened industrial atmospheres.

The band's name, \"Bölzer,\" is derived from a colloquial German term meaning \"a powerful force or blow or strike that has no regard for the consequences or the repercussions.\" Initially, the duo sought to include a bassist but eventually decided to proceed without one, creating a distinctive sound characterized by a ten-string guitar played by Jones and a powerful drum performance by Wyrsch. Their music blends elements of black and death metal, resulting in a raw, atmospheric sound that has garnered critical acclaim. In 2012, they released their first demo, \"Roman Acupuncture,\" followed by the EP \"Aura\" in 2013, which received significant praise from music critics and metal fans. Their debut full-length album, \"Hero,\" was released in 2016, showcasing their evolving musical style. Lyrically, the band draws on mythological themes, ancient cultures, folklore, Nietzsche, and paganism, with Jones citing psychedelics as an influence on their music. They have gained a reputation for their powerful live performances, often described as an \"atavistic vortex,\" delivering a chaotic, spiritual experience that captivates audiences. As of October 2025, Bölzer continues to be active, with recent performances including a tour with Australian band Portal in August 2025 and scheduled appearances at the Mystic Festival in Gdańsk, Poland, in 2026.",

Their music delves into themes of hatred, magic, misanthropy, and the philosophical musings of Blake, Nietzsche, and Crowley, crafting a soundscape that is both chaotic and deeply unsettling. Hevn III's debut album, \"Hevn III,\" was released on November 22, 2024, under Polypus Records. The album plunges listeners into a world where dissonance reigns, with every riff resonating with venomous intent. The band's live performances are noted for their sheer intensity, harking back to an era when black metal was raw, dissonant, and unfiltered. The current lineup consists of Likrøyk on bass, Orkan on drums, and Sortblot on guitar and vocals. Hevn III is currently signed to Polypus Records.",

      "description": "Mawiza is a Chilean metal band that seamlessly blends traditional Mapuche culture with modern groove metal, delivering a unique and powerful musical experience. Formed in 2014 under the name Nunca Seremos Dichosos, the band initially incorporated elements of indigenous folklore and Latin American music into their metal sound. Their debut album, \"Tierra,\" released in 2017, featured nine tracks that resonated with themes of identity and social issues, particularly aimed at the Latin American audience. In 2019, they released \"Kollong,\" which included \"Mawiza Ñi Piwke,\" the first metal song sung entirely in Mapudungun, the language of the Mapuche people. This album earned them the prestigious Pulsar Award for Best Metal Artist in 2020. After several lineup changes, the band rebranded as Mawiza in 2021, fully embracing Mapudungun in their music. Their third album, \"Ül,\" released on July 18, 2025, marks their first collaboration with Season of Mist. The album integrates tribal rhythms and ancient instruments into modern groove metal, paying homage to the Mapuche nation's ancestral spirit. Tracks like \"Wingkawnoam\" and \"Mamüll Reke\" exemplify this fusion, with \"Mamüll Reke\" receiving the Silver award in Metal/Hardcore Songwriting at the LIT Music Awards in October 2025. Mawiza's music serves as a cultural bridge, honoring their roots while appealing to a global audience. They have shared stages with renowned bands such as Gojira, Mastodon, Mercyful Fate, Slipknot, and Gojira, and have performed at major festivals, including Rock Al Parque 2025 in Colombia. Their commitment to preserving and promoting Mapuche culture through music continues to inspire and resonate with listeners worldwide.",

      "description": "Angus McSix is an international power metal band formed in August 2021 by Swiss singer Thomas Winkler and German producer, vocalist, and guitarist Sebastian \"Seeb\" Levermann. The formation of the band followed Winkler's departure from Gloryhammer, with Levermann reaching out to collaborate on a new power metal supergroup. The name \"Angus McSix\" is a continuation of Winkler's previous stage character, Angus McFife, symbolizing an upgraded and more powerful version of the character. To complete the lineup, the duo enlisted Italian guitarist Thalia Bellazecca and former Rhapsody of Fire drummer Manu Lotter. The band's debut studio album, \"Angus McSix and the Sword of Power,\" was released on April 21, 2023, through Napalm Records. The album continues the narrative of the fictional Scottish crown prince Angus McFife XIII, who returns from the realm of the dead as a stronger version of himself, now known as Angus McSix. The album achieved significant success, reaching number ten on the German album charts, number 16 in Switzerland, and number 26 in Austria, marking it as one of the most successful debuts for a power metal band in those countries. In January 2025, Winkler announced his departure from the band to focus on family, with Sam Nyman stepping in as the new vocalist portraying Prince Adam McSix. Additionally, Lotter departed, and Gerit Lamm joined as the new drummer. The band released a new single, \"6666,\" in January 2025, and another single, \"The Fire of Yore,\" in September 2025, featuring actor and musician Uwe Ochsenknecht in the official video. The band's music is characterized by a blend of late 1990s power metal and modern disco elements, drawing comparisons to bands like Sonata Arctica and Blind Guardian. The vocals are powerful and clear, often compared to Rob Halford or Ronnie James Dio, with song structures primarily in classic verse form.",

The band was established by vocalist Megan Targett, guitarist Jay Bacon, and drummer Willem Mason-Geraghty, who had previously played together in another band. Dissatisfied with their former group's direction, they decided to create a new project that allowed them to express themselves authentically. The name \"Vexed\" was inspired by the word's usage in \"The Count of Monte Cristo,\" reflecting the band's desire to channel their frustrations into their music. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexed_%28band%29?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn April 2019, Vexed released their debut single, \"Elite,\" featuring CJ McMahon of Thy Art Is Murder. The collaboration came about when Targett reached out to McMahon on Instagram; despite initial hesitation due to his busy schedule, he was impressed by the band's music and recorded his parts the following day. \"Elite\" garnered significant attention, amassing over 500,000 streams across various platforms by 2021. The band followed up with their second single, \"Dominate,\" in May 2019. That July, they performed their first live show at the UK Tech-Fest in Newark-on-Trent. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexed_%28band%29?utm_source=openai))\n\nIn January 2021, Vexed signed with Napalm Records and released their debut album, \"Culling Culture,\" on May 21, 2021. The album received positive reviews and featured tracks like \"Hideous,\" \"Epiphany,\" \"Misery,\" and \"Fake.\" The band performed at the 2021 Bloodstock Open Air festival and embarked on a headlining tour of the United Kingdom in January 2022. They also supported In Flames on their UK tour in March 2022 and Spiritbox on two London dates in June 2022. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vexed_%28band%29?utm_source=openai))\n\nOn June 23, 2023, Vexed released their second album, \"Negative Energy,\" which delved into themes of death, betrayal, pain, and grief. The album was produced by Meyrick de La Fuente, who also played bass on the record. Following its release, the band toured the United Kingdom in October 2023 and Europe with Cabal in January 2024. They also supported Carnifex in March and April 2024. In January and February 2025, Vexed toured Europe supporting Silent Planet, marking their first tour without label backing. The band faced financial challenges during this tour, raising funds through a GoFundMe campaign and organizing raffles to cover the remaining costs.

Metzner and Fischer, friends since their youth, previously played together in the medieval rock band Feuerschwanz. In December 2017, Fischer departed from both Feuerschwanz and DArtagnan, citing personal differences. He was replaced by Gustavo Strauss, who introduced the violin to the band's sound. DArtagnan describes their musical style as \"musketeer rock,\" blending modern rock sounds with folk rhythms and lyrics celebrating love of life, compassion, friendship, camaraderie, and courage. Their discography includes: 1. \"Seit an Seit\" (2016) 2. \"Verehrt und verdammt\" (2017) 3. \"In jener Nacht\" (2019) 4. \"Feuer \u0026 Flamme\" (2021) 5. \"Felsenfest\" (2022) 6. \"Herzblut\" (2024) The band has also collaborated with Candice Night from Blackmore's Night on the single \"We're Gonna Be Drinking\" from \"Felsenfest\" (2022).",

Following the departure of Aegnor and Argoth, Neige continued Alcest as a solo endeavor, incorporating elements of shoegaze and post-metal into the band's sound. In 2009, drummer Winterhalter joined Alcest, marking a new chapter in the band's evolution. Alcest is widely credited with pioneering the \"blackgaze\" genre, blending black metal with shoegaze influences. Their discography includes seven studio albums, with \"Les Chants de l'Aurore\" released on June 21, 2024. The album received generally positive reviews and debuted at number 77 in France.

They are renowned for their intense and controversial performances, as well as their profound influence on the black metal genre. The original lineup included guitarist Øystein \"Euronymous\" Aarseth, bassist Jørn \"Necrobutcher\" Stubberud, and drummer Kjetil \"Manheim\" Haraldsson. The band's early music was heavily influenced by bands like Venom, Motörhead, Black Sabbath, Slayer, Bathory, and Celtic Frost. Their debut EP, \"Deathcrush,\" released in 1987, is considered a seminal work in black metal. In 1988, Swedish vocalist Per \"Dead\" Ohlin joined the band, bringing a distinctive stage presence and contributing to the band's notoriety. Dead's performances were marked by the use of \"corpse paint\" and often involved self-mutilation, adding to the band's dark and theatrical image. The band's history is marked by tragedy, including the suicide of Dead in 1991 and the murder of Euronymous in 1993 by former bassist Varg Vikernes. Despite these events, Mayhem continued to evolve, releasing albums like \"Grand Declaration of War\" in 2000, which showcased a more avant-garde and progressive approach to black metal. Their 2004 album \"Chimera\" featured vocalist Maniac and continued to push the boundaries of the genre. In 2021, Mayhem celebrated their 40th anniversary with a special North American tour, featuring a setlist that spanned their illustrious career. The band's current lineup includes Necrobutcher (bass), Hellhammer (drums), Attila Csihar (vocals), Teloch (guitars), and Ghul (guitars). Mayhem remains a significant and influential force in the black metal scene, known for their uncompromising music and live performances.",

      "description": "Vintersorg is a Swedish metal band from Skellefteå, formed in 1994 under the name Vargatron. The band's music spans various heavy metal genres, including black metal, folk metal, progressive metal, and avant-garde metal. Lyrically, they explore themes such as fantasy, mythology, nature, the cosmos, and metaphysics. The name \"Vintersorg,\" meaning \"Winter Sorrow,\" was inspired by the character Vintersorg from Margit Sandemo's \"The Legend of the Ice People\" series, who is the son of a great pagan leader. Initially, the band aimed to push the boundaries of black metal by incorporating clean vocals and acoustic guitars alongside heavy riffs. Over time, their sound evolved, with earlier works like \"Till Fjälls\" (1998) and \"Ödemarkens Son\" (1999) showcasing a strong folk influence. The 2000 album \"Cosmic Genesis\" marked a shift towards more progressive and experimental elements, delving into themes of astronomy and cosmology. This progression continued with albums like \"Visions from the Spiral Generator\" (2002) and \"The Focusing Blur\" (2004), which further embraced avant-garde metal styles. In 2017, they returned to their folk roots with \"Till Fjälls, del II,\" focusing on nature-inspired mysticism and Nordic folklore. The band's lineup has remained consistent, with Andreas \"Vintersorg\" Hedlund as the primary member, supported by guitarist Mattias Marklund and bassist Simon Lundström. Vintersorg's discography includes notable albums such as \"Till Fjälls\" (1998), \"Ödemarkens Son\" (1999), \"Cosmic Genesis\" (2000), \"Visions from the Spiral Generator\" (2002), \"The Focusing Blur\" (2004), \"Solens Rötter\" (2007), \"Jordpuls\" (2011), \"Orkan\" (2012), \"Naturbål\" (2014), \"Till Fjälls, del II\" (2017), and \"Vattenkrafternas Spel\" (2025).",

      "description": "Dominum is a German power metal band from Nuremberg, formed in 2022. The band was founded by vocalist and producer Felix Heldt, known as Dr. Dead, who envisioned a zombie-themed group inspired by his love for \"The Walking Dead\" and \"The Last of Us.\" The lineup includes guitarist Tommy Kemp, bassist Patient Zero, and drummer Victor Hiltop. Dominum's music blends energetic metal riffs with theatrical elements, creating a unique sound that combines the influences of bands like Ghost and Sabaton. Their debut album, \"Hey Living People,\" was released on December 29, 2023, via Napalm Records, entering the top 20 of the German Album Charts. The album features tracks like \"Immortalis Dominum\" and \"Danger Danger,\" showcasing the band's storytelling prowess and musical energy. In 2024, Dominum released their second album, \"The Dead Don't Die,\" on December 27, continuing their exploration of horror-inspired themes with heavier metal influences. The band has toured extensively, supporting acts such as Bruce Dickinson, Avantasia, Feuerschwanz, and Peyton Parrish, and has performed at festivals like Graspop and Rock Harz. Their theatrical live shows, characterized by their undead personas, have captivated audiences across Europe.",

      "description": "Wolvennest is a Belgian experimental psychedelic doom metal collective formed in 2015 by guitarists Michel Kirby (Arkangel), Corvus Von Burtle (Cult of Erinyes), and Marc De Backer (Mongolito). Known for their dark, hypnotic, and ritualistic sound blending elements of Krautrock, black metal, and ambient music with vocals by Shazzula and other guests, they create immersive \"dark trips\" through their music and live shows featuring surreal projections. Their debut album featured members of Der Blutharsch and was followed by several more albums, including their 2025 release Procession, with the band continuing to explore themes of occultism, death, and existence.
